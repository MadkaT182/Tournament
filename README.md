# Tournament
SM5 Tournament base theme, inspired in UKSRT events themes. Is not a finished version.

To config it, just edit the file ('Scripts/00 Config').

The theme has custom commands to avoid picking a song by error.

To play the current song just press Up,Down,Up,Down,Start.
To finish the actual round and advance to the next stage press Left,Right,Left,Right,Start.

Suggestions, fixes and feedback are welcome.
